# Digit Recognizer Documentation

When launching the application you will be greeted by a popup displaying the page's title and author's GitHub, from which you can subsequently continue onwards by clicking the ARROW on the top left corner of the screen.

At this point, you will find that there is a wide range of options that can be interacted with, the main ones being the drawable canvas and display buttons.

Before starting to draw digits, note that BRUSH and ERASER draw modes can be switched by pressing the bottom left button and the canvas cleared with the CLEAR button.

Being a digit recognizer application, when pressing the PREDICT button you will send a POST request to the server, which, after preprocessing the whole image performing OCR techniques, will return a JSON object containing the pertinent response data to be displayed and analized.

Finally, the MENU on the bottom right corner lets you access the internal DATABASE containing predicted digit data, the MODEL static configuration and the DOCUMENTATION itself.
